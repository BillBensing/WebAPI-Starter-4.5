# WebAPI-Starter-4.5

## Welcome!
I hate spending hours just to set up new projects.  To show some love, I created an all-encompassing starter project for RESTful web services with MVC 4.

My vision is an out-of-the-box "Enterprise Grade" foundation with features such as MVC, IoC, AOP, Logging, Unit Testing and more.

Why does this matter?  Having a solid foundation with properly implemented design patterns, IoC Containers, and Logging allows you to focus on solving problems, not application configuration.

I have taken a very opinionated approach to the architecture and organization of this project.  It has a standard project structure that keeps you thinking about code.
